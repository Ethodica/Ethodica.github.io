      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Personally, I'm working on making my skills at photoshop better, to improve and get the best I can as a hobby. Professionally though, getting high grades while having a social life is my main goal, with just past school years leading me here, like finding out about photoshop in 6th grade.

I get better through my photoshop by just messing around in it, making things and trying out new styles to incorporate into my own. In school I just go and try to socialize more than I did previous years, and my grades just get better overtime.

For success, I'd say that you need to have a good idea of what you want to do. If you don't have any sort of goal to work towards, then you probably wont have motivation to do anything.

In the near future, I hope to (finally) get my drivers license, despite being 16, I hate driving due to bad experiences. Though with time, it'll get easier, and end up finally getting it.

I'd rather be most known for the things that I do that I can be proud of. For example, the four adobe certifications that I worked hard to get. Another thing to be known for is how I do the work that I'm given.
